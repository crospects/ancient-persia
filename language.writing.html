                            The Persians used many languages, both written and spoken, but all of them greatly impacted their culture. Every area of Persia had itâ€™s own local language; even within Persia, you could tell where someone was from just by the language they spoke. The Persians also developed an efficient pony express system of mail delivery along the royal road. They used a Cuneiform writing system made up of triangular shaped letters engraved on clay tablets. The Cyrus the Great Cylinder, a document written on baked clay, was written entirely in Cuneiform writing. Many folktales were passed down by word of mouth, and not written down. The Romans wrote a lot about the Persians, and from their records, much about their empire. Without writing, much of the information we know about the Persians would not be accessible to us today.
