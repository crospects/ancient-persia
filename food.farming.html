                            The Persians relied heavily on farming for food and trade, to help them keep up with the huge demand, they developed some of the most amazing systems of the ancient world. 
                            <br><br>
                            Most of the highland area of Persia was a dry desert, the land wasn’t nearly wet enough for farming, to bring enough water to grow crops, the ancient Persians developed an ingenious system of underground water delivery called a qanat. 
                            <br><br>
                            The qanat carried water from the mountains, underground, for up to 100 miles. The longest ever qanat is in the iranian city of Gonabad. Even after 2,700 years, it still provides water to it’s residents. 
                            <br><br>
                            The persians  built a canal connecting the Mediterranean and Red Seas, this allowed them to trade with more people, and much increased their empire's prosperity. 
                            <br><br>
                            Many caravans with went through Persia, allowing for easy trade with the passing merchants.
                            The royal road also  provided them with an easy route across Persia, increasing the possibility for trade even further. 
                            <br><br>
                            These systems greatly impacted ancient Persian agriculture, without them, Persian farming would not have been the same.
